# PC2-scoreboard
[PC^2 programmming contest software](https://pc2.ecs.csus.edu/) automatically generates a local scoreboard in HTML. I want to display this scoreboard on our GitHub Pages site, but also have it be relevant within 1 to 2 minutes of real time. This script gets that HTML file from the PC^2 working directory, copies it over to our local site repository and pushes the changes every minute.

As you can probably tell from the code, this script was used for Shaker Coding Club's 2017 Coding Competition (which used PC^2)
